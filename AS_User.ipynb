    "> 5. This current version supports protein combinations only.\n",
    "> 6. In split, ace and rico you can input the sequence of the protein as a string instead of its name. Then in the file, the first 7 letters of the sequence will be used as a name for that protein\n",
    "> 7. Future versions will include:\n",
    ">     - Have parameters to include ligands, ions etc.\n",
