    "> 1. When this window gets annoying, click the arrow pointing down to the left of \"Blueprints\".\n",
    "> 2. AlphaStream functions will create files in your current directory.\n",
    "> 3. Before using the functions, run the first block of code one cell above: `import AlphaStream as mit`\n",
    "> 4. If you decide to use the `file_name` parameter, make sure it’s a string containing only letters, like `'thisisafilename'`. The filename will be time stamped to avoid overwriting files with the same name.\n",
    "> 5. This version currently supports protein combinations only.\n",
    "> 6. In `split`, `ace`, `rico` and `pair`, you can input the sequence of a protein as a string instead of its name. In the output file, the first 7 letters of the sequence will be used as the name for that protein.\n",
    "> 7. Future versions will include:\n",
    ">     - Parameters to include ligands, ions, DNA/RNA molecules etc.\n",
    ">     - A function that lets you run the jobs an AlphaFold installed locally\n",
